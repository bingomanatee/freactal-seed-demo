This is a demo site for [Freactal-Seed](https://github.com/bingomanatee/freactal-seed).
it is a fairly stock React site, packaged by neutrinorc. to execute, run `npm run start`.

It executes on port 5000.

It uses the BigStock image api to get content. Which will of course be up forever
and never change its API.
